# Reproduced CSV of the Results

All runs were executed 10 times to calculate the average results for each method.

## üìä Fig 9 and Fig 10 (cuJSON vs CPU Methods)

To run each method separately and get the results for each dataset (executed 10 times), use the following commands:

- **cuJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_cujson_fig9.sh
  ```

- **simdJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_simdjson_fig9.sh
  ```

- **RapidJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_rapidjson_fig9.sh
  ```

- **Pison**  
  ```bash
  ./run_pison_fig9.sh
  ```

If you'd like to run all methods together, simply execute:

```bash
run_all_fig9.sh
```

### Results Location:
- All method results can be found in `scripts/results/fig9_data.csv`.
- Individual method results are saved in `scripts/results/` under:
  - `cujson_fig9.csv`
  - `simdjson_fig9.csv`
  - `rapidjson_fig9.csv`
  - `pison_fig9.csv`

## üìà Fig 11 (cuJSON vs GPU Methods)

To run each method separately for Fig 11:

- **GPJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_gpjson_fig11.sh
  ```

- **cuDF**  
  ```bash
  ./run_cuDF_fig11.sh
  ```

If you'd like to run both methods together, use the following:

```bash
run_all_fig11.sh
```

### Results Location:
- All method results are stored in `scripts/results/fig11_data.csv`.
- Individual results can be found in `scripts/results/` under:
  - `cujson_fig9.csv`
  - `gpjson_fig11.csv`
  - `cudf_fig11.csv`

## üíª Fig 12: Peak GPU Memory

To report peak GPU memory usage for each method:

- **cuJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_cujson_fig12.sh
  ```

- **GPJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_gpjson_fig12.sh
  ```

- **cuDF**  
  ```bash
  ./run_cudf_fig12.sh
  ```

To run all methods together:

```bash
./run_all_fig12.sh
```

> **Note**: MetaJSON is not included in performance tests as it requires very huge compile time and only works for a few simplified test cases without branches. We include it only to show that our proposed method outperforms it.

### Results Location:
- All method results are stored in `scripts/results/fig12_data.csv`.
- Individual results can be found in `scripts/results/` under:
  - `cujson_fig12.csv`
  - `gpjson_fig12.csv`
  - `cudf_fig12.csv`

## ‚è±Ô∏è Fig 13 and Table 8 (cuJSON only)

For time-breakdown reporting with **cuJSON**, execute the following:

```bash
./run_cujson_fig13.sh
```

> **Note**: We are unable to provide scripts for other methods' time-breakdowns due to the need for code modifications after compilation and library installation. 

### Results Location:
- All method results are stored in `scripts/results/fig13_data.csv`.

## üß† Fig 14: Reporting Output Memory

To run each method separately and report memory usage:

- **cuJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_cujson_fig14.sh
  ```

- **simdJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_simdjson_fig14.sh
  ```

- **RapidJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_rapidjson_fig14.sh
  ```

- **Pison**  
  ```bash
  ./run_pison_fig14.sh
  ```

- **cuDF/MetaJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_cudf_fig14.sh
  ```

> **Note**: To compute results for **GPJSON**, the library requires modifications. This library lead to no output and it required to modify the source code after installation.

To run all methods together:

```bash
./run_all_fig14.sh
```

### Results Location:
- All method results are stored in `scripts/results/fig14_data.csv`.
- Individual results can be found in `scripts/results/` under:
  - `cujson_fig14.csv`
  - `simdjson_fig14.csv`
  - `rapidjson_fig14.csv`
  - `pison_fig14.csv`
  - `cudf_fig14.csv`

## üïí Fig 15: Running Query Timings

### Left: Average Query Time

To report the average time for running the queries, execute the scripts for each method:

- **cuJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_cujson_fig15.sh
  ```

- **simdjson**  
  ```bash
  ./run_simdjson_fig15.sh
  ```

- **Pison**  
  ```bash
  ./run_pison_fig15.sh
  ```

- **RapidJSON**  
  ```bash
  ./run_rapidjson_fig15.sh
  ```

> **Note**: The results will include the average time displayed in the final row of the output.

To run all methods together:

```bash
./run_all_fig15.sh
```

### Results Location:
- All method results are stored in `scripts/results/fig15_data.csv`.
- Individual results can be found in `scripts/results/` under:
  - `cujson_fig15.csv`
  - `simdjson_fig15.csv`
  - `rapidjson_fig15.csv`
  - `pison_fig15.csv`

### Middle and Right: Modifying JSON Files

For these sections, you will need to modify the JSON file to contain only one record to compute the query time. Library modifications are required for **GPJSON** and **cuDF**, so ensure you install the libraries and use them accordingly.


---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Fig 16: cuJSON Scalability

To run **cuJSON** scalability tests:

1. First, download the scalability data.
2. Then, execute the following:

```bash
./run_cujson_fig16.sh
```

### Results Location:
- All method results are stored in `scripts/results/fig16_data.csv`.


---

### General Notes:

- All scripts assume you have the necessary dependencies installed.
- The `scripts/results` folder will contain all output files, categorized by method and csvs.
- For specific modifications or troubleshooting, refer to the individual script files, or readme of each relarted works for more details.


Happy experimenting! üöÄ
