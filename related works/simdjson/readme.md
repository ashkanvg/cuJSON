# SIMDJSON

Here are instructions on running simdjson for Standandard JSON and JSON Lines. 


## Quick Start
We put three different possible codes. 
1. Using 'iterate' APIs for parsing Standard JSON
2. Using 'parser_many' APIs for parsing JSON Lines
3. The performance of each query mentioned in the paper.  

### 1. iterate


### 2. parse_many


### 3. query results
