## Datasets
Two sample datasets are included in `dataset` folder. Large datasets (used in performance evaluation) can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PkDEy0zWOkVREfL7VuINI-m9wJe45P2Q?usp=sharing and placed into the `dataset` folder. For JSON Lines, use those datasets that ended in `_small_records.json`.
